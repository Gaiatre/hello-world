# Me
heyyyyyyy so watched arcane and it wrecked me. i watched interview with a vampire and it wrecked me. i need  some showss that dont try and make me wanna pull my brain out and put it on my desk and just sit and stare into space.
wanted to watch adventure time but apparently that's also wrecky.
I was reading the ravenous fate and honestly its pretty good. didnt realise the author was a newbie. read the "Library at Mount Char". Cool book. Cool premise.I swear to god everytime i try to read the bridge 4 series by Brandon Sanderson i wanna keep reading but its so deep and intricate that i need to keep taking breaks. it so good tho dude.
